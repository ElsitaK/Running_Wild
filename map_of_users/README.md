View this notebook in your browser by running a web server from inside this folder using Bash/terminal. 

For example:

~~~sh
cd ~/map_of_users
python -m http.server
~~~

this should result in a message similar to:
"Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ..."

and then paste the following URL into the browser window based on the port indicated in the bash message:
http://0.0.0.0:8000/index.html
